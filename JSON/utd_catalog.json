But the problem of national and international security continue to be a dominant concern of national and international political and economic life, just as it has been for more than sixty years. Many nations continue to maintain high levels of military expenditure as a mainstay of their security policy. Yet, there has been a profound change in the nature of the threats to security since the Cold War. Some, like the threat of intentional full-scale global nuclear war, have receded. Others, like the threat posed by nuclear proliferation and the terrorism of mass destruction, have increased. From acute hot spots to longer-term questions of restructuring power and security arrangements in a post-Cold War world, understanding the deeper issues of national and international security is critical to understanding what lies behind the headlines -- and what strategies are likely to be effective in achieving real security. Topics include: the nature and meaning of security; security and military force; terrorism, accidents and accidental war; nuclear proliferation; the international arms trade; the experience of war; the economics of security policy; social and psychological factors; and strategies for achieving security by nonmilitary means.",

Why did Swedish firms help to introduce a free universal health care system ? Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms ? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations.

        "Description": "Since the late 20th century, human development theory (HDT) has inspired the way that the world envisions and practices international development, particularly for marginalized peoples and communities. From large multilateral agencies like the World Bank, bilateral donors like USAID, international and national nonprofit organizations, governments, to grassroots civil society organizations, the definition and purpose of development is shifting. Today, much of work of key stakeholders like Malala's Fund, Partners in Health, Save the Children, DFiD, and the Millenium Development and Sustainable Development Goals (MDGs/SDGs) builds on the principles of HDT. This development approach considers `` namely, advancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live, which is only a part of it''. HDT seeks to improve individual capacities and human freedom. This course will introduce students to the history of international development policy in relation to the eventual promotion of HDT. Students will learn more about how international development policy, programs, agencies, nonprofits, and donors can work together to improve the quality of life with dignity for those who often face dire poverty, injustice, systemic violence, and insecurity. We will explore key'freedoms' (political, economic, social opportunities, transparency, and protective securities) that help unleash the potential of individuals to overcome obstacles and become actors of change in their life, community, and nation. This course is recommended for any students who have an interest in working in nonprofit, health, foreign service, international development, human rights, or public policy. Students will complete weekly readings and practices, as well as participate in course discussions and debates. Over the course of the semester, students will have the opportunity to work individually, in groups, and/or with an external agency to write a grant proposal or to complete a research paper on a relevant topic of their choice.",

The class will focus on the politics of government decisions surrounding illicit markets, including prohibition, enforcement, and international cooperation. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to think about the intersection of economic and security issues, alongside the applied public policy concerns around control different types of transnational crime. Topics will include several cross-border illicit markets such as illegal drugs, small arms, wildlife, and kidnapping. The class centers around understanding five questions about each topic: Who is gaining or losing from the illicit market ? What stage is illegal (production, transit, consumption) ? When did the issue area become a regional or international concern ? Where does the illicit commodity move ? Why is the trade illegal in some places (and perhaps not others) ? (Same as PSCI 4317)",

When economic explanations fall short, analyzing the role of politics in finance can provide answers. This course aims to provide such answers by analyzing the interplay between politics and finance. The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as `` What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events ? ``, `` How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks ? ``, `` Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam ? ``, and `` Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not ?'' This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government. Future investors and government officials will need the skills necessary to analyze the two-way relationship of politics affecting finance and finance shaping politics.",

But the problem of national and international security continue to be a dominant concern of national and international political and economic life, just as it has been for more than sixty years. Many nations continue to maintain high levels of military expenditure as a mainstay of their security policy. Yet, there has been a profound change in the nature of the threats to security since the Cold War. Some, like the threat of intentional full-scale global nuclear war, have receded. Others, like the threat posed by nuclear proliferation and the terrorism of mass destruction, have increased. From acute hot spots to longer-term questions of restructuring power and security arrangements in a post-Cold War world, understanding the deeper issues of national and international security is critical to understanding what lies behind the headlines -- and what strategies are likely to be effective in achieving real security. Topics include: the nature and meaning of security; security and military force; terrorism, accidents and accidental war; nuclear proliferation; the international arms trade; the experience of war; the economics of security policy; social and psychological factors; and strategies for achieving security by nonmilitary means.",
