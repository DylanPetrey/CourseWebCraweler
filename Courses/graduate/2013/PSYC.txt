It will focus on the fact that our social judgments are not based on the laws of probability and chance, but on other cognitive processes that may have serious shortcomings in important inferential and decision making tasks. We will also see that these processes, while ecologically efficient, systematic and often predictable, are imperfect in today's data-rich environment. (3-0) T
