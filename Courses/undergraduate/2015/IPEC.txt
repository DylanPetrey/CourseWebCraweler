IPEC 4301 Political Economy of Industrialized Countries (3 semester credit hours) How can German carmakers be among the best in the world if they are required to give two years notice before firing someone? Why did Swedish firms help to introduce a free universal health care system? Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations. Using case studies, this course offers students opportunities to sharpen their analytical skills with real world applications and expand upon black-and-white theories from business and economics.

IPEC 4302 Political Economy of Developing Countries (3 semester credit hours) We typically assume that democracy is good for economic growth. But if this is the case, how do we explain China's economic success? Similarly, economic theory states that governments should not interfere with the market, but why did South Korea industrialize at an incredible pace by doing exactly that while Argentina failed miserably? Why are natural resources a blessing in Botswana but a curse in Nigeria? If we have learned anything from developing countries' experiences, it is that there is no universal "one-size-fits-it-all" answer. This course explores the conditions under which grand theories of development are valid. It is crucial to take these differences in local conditions into account when developing policy recommendations or investment strategies. Using case studies in every class, this course offers students opportunities to sharpen their analytical skills to make sense of a complicated world. (3-0) T

IPEC 4305 Topics in Science, Technology and Institutions (3 semester credit hours) This course introduces the student to important facets of the relationship between science, technology and political-social institutions. The course begins by addressing issues relating to the philosophy of science and related epistemological concerns, i.e. "how do we know what we know?" Issues of deductive and inductive logic are explored, and different viewpoints, including Kuhnian and Popperian approaches to the philosophy of science are examined. The course also examines issues related to the relationship between science and politics. For example, does science promote democracy, and vice versa? Lastly, the course addresses important contemporary topics related to climate change, biotechnology and genetic engineering, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, and other topics, with the aim of examining the science-technology-society nexus.

IPEC 4310 Environmental and Health Policy in East Asia (3 semester credit hours) Rapid development in East Asia has brought economic wealth to individuals in this region but has also created serious environmental and health problems such as pollution, resource depletion, pandemics, climate change, and so on. This course explores the environmental and human health challenges in East Asia as well as how governments and other actors are addressing them through various approaches to "sustainable development." East Asia is defined for this course as the region encompassing China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and some countries in Southeast Asia, but we will also focus on the role of the United States as it has been extensively involved in this region, when necessary. To help build the fundamental background of students' understanding of current environmental and health issues in East Asia, the course begins with an overview of historical, geographic, socioeconomic, political, and cultural issues in East Asia, and then examines ongoing policy actions to address various environmental and health problems in the region. Students are expected to take an active role in reviewing and discussing the material and, more importantly, in thinking critically about the interrelations of environment and human health in East Asia.

IPEC 4377 Politics of International Finance (3 semester credit hours) When explaining financial crises, economic theory is often confronted with puzzles such as: A speculative attack was launched against the currency of one country, while a neighboring country with virtually identical economic conditions remained untouched. When economic explanations fall short, analyzing the role of politics in finance can provide answers. This course aims to provide such answers by analyzing the interplay between politics and finance. The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as "What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events?", "How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks?", "Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam?", and "Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not?" This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government. Future investors and government officials will need the skills necessary to analyze the two-way relationship of politics affecting finance and finance shaping politics. (3-0) R
IPEC 4384 Health and Environmental Policy: A Global Perspective (3 semester credit hours) This course covers emerging issues in global health and environmental policy, with special emphasis on applications of Geographic Information System (GIS) and spatial analytic tools in identifying and responding to physical and social environmental risk factors that impact the health and well-being of peoples throughout the world. This introductory but interdisciplinary course examines contemporary issues in global health and environmental policy and practices. This course helps students understand various social, economic, political and environmental determinants of health, and consider evidences that inequalities in education, income and accessibility to resources influence health status. Emphasis is placed on issues of global health inequality and environmental justice at various levels. Ample hands-on laboratory experiences will be provided on how to utilize various geospatial methods such as spatial analysis, modeling, simulation and mapping with real-world data using state-of-the-art commercial and open source software. Students will also develop skills in cost-effectiveness analysis and health outcome measurement, using a variety of contemporary global health case studies which focus on content areas such as maternal and child health, environmental health, infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria, diarrheal diseases, etc.) and global healthcare delivery. Students may need some quantitative skills to analyze global public health problems, but the level of the analytical components of the course will be determined by the background of the enrolled students.
