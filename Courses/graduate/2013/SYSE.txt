SYSE 6321 Systems Integration (3 semester hours) Introduction to systems integration in complex systems using the automotive sector as an example; plan, organize and manage the integration of complex automotive systems; understand the decomposition/integration paradigm to manage complexity; define metrics to define achievement of objectives; and, demonstrate ability to work in cross-functional/multi-disciplinary teams. Features of the course include: Team approach; simulated production environment including (virtual) client and vendor interaction in the face of unpredictable (virtual) external events; cross-disciplinary. Intended for a broad audience of engineering graduate students regardless of their specific knowledge or interest in automotive systems or that industry. (3-0) T
