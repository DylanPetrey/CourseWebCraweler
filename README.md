# CourseWebCraweler

https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2022/graduate/courses/school
 
I found a website that contains all the utd graduate courses. I noticed that by changing the year in the URL, that it would bring up all the courses that were offered that year. I wrote a pyton script that would crawl over each of the prefixes and parse each website, extracting the courses and prerequsites. Putting every course into a JSON is definitly overkill but a student might have some additional electives so I figured it would be best just to be safe. I can always change it to cut out schools.
