ISSS 4377 Alternative Approaches to National Security (3 semester credit hours) There is a pressing need to reconsider how nations can best achieve security in the face of drastic changes in the international arena in the last decades of the twentieth century.

At the same time, important progress has been made in arms reduction, international cooperation, and the spread of democracy. In the light of these changes, this course explores a variety of alternatives to the traditional threat or use of massive military force as a means for achieving national and global security. (3-0) R
